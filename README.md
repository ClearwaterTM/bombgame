# Java bomb game

A group project I participated in during the third year of my comsci studies at university.

This is a board game where the objective is to deplete all the other players health to zero, via the usage of weapons such as bombs, firearms and mines.


# Installation:

Clone the repo: `git pull https://github.com/ClearwaterTM/bombgame` \
Build the game .jar from the ANT script: `ant jar` \
Open the game: `ant run`
